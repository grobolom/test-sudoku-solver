# test-sudoku-solver
Trying to make a backtracking sudoku solver in Elixir

### inputs
```
[
  [0,0,4,5,0,9,0,0,0],
  [0,2,8,7,0,0,9,0,0],
  [0,7,9,0,4,0,0,0,8],
  [0,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,4],
  [0,0,0,0,9,0,3,0,6],
  [0,0,0,2,5,0,0,1,0],
  [0,9,0,0,2,0,4,6,0],
  [0,6,0,9,0,5,0,0,0],
  [7,0,0,3,0,4,1,2,0],
]
```

### output
A solved sudoku

### ideas
maybe we can take input by just doing a big long string and displaying the
result. Meaning the above just goes 0045090000287 .... etc.
